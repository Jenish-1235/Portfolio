## Introduction

Transformers are one of the most influential breakthroughs in deep learning, especially in natural language processing (NLP). Introduced in the 2017 paper ["Attention is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), they replaced recurrent models with a fully attention-based approach.

## Key Concepts

- **Self-Attention**: Allows each token to attend to every other token in a sequence, capturing long-range dependencies efficiently.
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Parallelizes attention mechanisms to capture different types of relationships.
- **Positional Encoding**: Injects sequence order into input embeddings.

## Equation Overview

The self-attention mechanism computes attention scores using:

```math
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
